//! F11 (Phase F): a minimal rust-libp2p backend behind the same surface
//! [`crate::SignedFrameTransport`] exposes — QUIC (peer authentication is
//! built into QUIC's libp2p TLS handshake), framed send/recv of the same
//! JSON messages, plus the ADR-018 amended-staging raw-JSON passthrough
//! ([`Libp2pSession::send_json`]/[`Libp2pSession::recv_json`]) with the
//! same stash discipline as the staged backend's [`crate::Session`], so
//! cooperative extension families (bare JSON frames, e.g. ADR-032
//! VerifyDrafts) ride QUIC without joining the frozen §6 typed surface.
//!
//! Non-loopback listeners are refused by default (the ADR-018 honesty
//! guard applies to every backend until the full Phase F ops set — public
//! relay, AutoNAT — is reviewed). Since 2026-10-13 the ONLY lift is the
//! explicit [`ListenOptions::allow_off_loopback`] argument at the call
//! site: the historical `MSP_LISTENER=1` environment escape hatch is
//! RETIRED and never read, so a stale machine-scope variable cannot open
//! an off-loopback bind, and product policy (the desktop's settings
//! toggle) reaches this guard as a typed parameter instead of
//! process-global state. Keys derive from the [`InstallationIdentity`]
//! seed, so a node's libp2p `PeerId` equals its ADR-020 `peer_id()`
//! derivation byte for byte, and `dial` verifies the connected peer's
//! QUIC-authenticated PeerId against the expected derivation.
//!
//! Driving model (the F11 fix): libp2p-quic's transport must be polled
//! **continuously** for the server side of the handshake to progress —
//! polling only while a caller awaits `accept` loses the connection
//! window. Each listener therefore owns a dedicated driver task pumping
//! `TransportEvent`s into a channel; `accept` is a channel read.
//!
//! This backend is experimental and feature-gated (`libp2p-backend`); the
//! workspace stays green without it (ADR-018: the trait is the swap point).
