//! Eligibility: the host-to-consume rule's artifacts (ADR-012).
//!
//! - [`EligibilityLease`]: the hub-signed lease (lease-capped TTL,
//!   peer/profile binding, multi-use with single-use request ids). Renames
//!   the artifact msp-v1 §5 called "capability token".
//! - [`CapacityClass`]: measured, never self-reported, serving capacity.
//! - `audit_epoch`: cheap revocation propagation (leases referencing a stale
//!   epoch are rejected without per-token lookups).
//! - [`suspension`]: the deterministic suspension policy table (slots to
//!   zero, 5 min / 30 min / 24 h escalating backoff, decay after 100 clean
//!   serves).
//!
//! Bootstrap allowance is OFF by default and exists only as an
//! experiments-scoped flag until Phase F evidence (ADR-012).
