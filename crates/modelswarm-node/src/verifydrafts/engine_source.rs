//! The composed daemon's family-engine seam (ADR-032 light-up tier,
//! feature `verifydrafts`).
//!
//! The serve paths stay engine-agnostic behind
//! `Arc<dyn BatchVerifyEngine>` (the [`super::serve::serve_verifydrafts_session`]
//! argument — the existing TimingEngine seam's pattern: the loop wraps
//! whatever it is given and measures it). THIS type is the one place that
//! knows WHICH engine backs the family:
//!
//! - [`FamilyEngineSource::Shared`] — one fixed engine for every session:
//!   the mock/stub venue of the plain serve paths and every scripted test;
//! - [`FamilyEngineSource::Capi`] (only under `verifydrafts-capi`, the G4
//!   bridge) — Runtime's production [`CapiVerifyEngine`], constructed
//!   fresh per family session (one handle per session on the shared
//!   adapter; multiple engines may share an adapter — the
//!   one-bundle-per-process guard applies to the ADAPTER, ADR-031 §2) and
//!   PREFILLED with the pinned session prompt.
//!
//! # The prompt gap (recorded, out-of-band pinning)
//!
//! The family's wire and gate never carry the session PROMPT — the
//! coordinator's draft windows chain on the prefix hash, and the verifier
//! must already hold the same prompt in engine KV
//! ([`modelswarm_session::verifydrafts::BatchVerifyEngine`] has no
//! prefill surface; the wiring handoff's G3 records the offer's missing
//! profile/params binding — the prompt is the same family of gap). The
//! seam therefore pins the prompt from daemon configuration, exactly as
//! `VerifyDraftsServeConfig` pins the profile id and sampling parameters,
//! and the Capi variant commits it as the PREFILLED root at engine
//! construction — before any window can arrive.
//!
//! # How the offer-form-v3 fields interact with the prefill (ADR-032
//! revision 4 §3/G3 + the compose handoff's G6, folded 2026-10-12)
//!
//! The v3 offer's `profile_id` and `generation_params_hash` are
//! negotiation-time DISCOVERY: the serve loop compares both against its
//! own pinned config and rejects `profile_mismatch` / `params_mismatch`
//! before any accept. That closes the pairing half of the prefill
//! assumption: the engine behind this seam is loaded under the daemon's
//! pinned profile, and every `verify_window` pass runs under the pinned
//! sampling parameters — a coordinator whose profile or params differ can
//! no longer open the session at all, so the prefilled KV can never be
//! consumed by a mismatched pairing. The PROMPT itself remains out of
//! band: nothing in the offer (or any family frame) commits the
//! coordinator's prompt, so the daemon's `prompt_tokens` and the
//! coordinator's session prompt must still be pinned to the same
//! tokenization by configuration. The residual gap — no
//! prompt(-hash) commitment exists on the wire, so a misconfigured
//! pairing is detectable only through acceptance collapse / audit
//! divergence — is RECORDED, not improvised: closing it needs a
//! freeze-ADR decision (a prompt-hash echo or commitment field), and this
//! seam remains the single place to feed whatever lands
//! (`FamilyEngineSource::Capi { prompt_tokens }`).
